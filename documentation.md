Features that we need fr fr:

File Encryption at Rest - crypto.py
Digital Signatures & Checksums - integrity.py
Access Auditing & Logging. - audit_logger.py
Rate Limiting / Lockout Policies - rate_limiter.py
End-to-End Integrity Checks - integrity.py

Secure Metadata Protection - no fucking clue

Ideally, we need some kinda program that runs all the other programs in order or something, because we need to run different kinda tests on the same fuckass text file, so that we can actively have a measure of what tests are being passed, and what are not so that we can show Tarapore the data.

Differences to note:

In the original crypto.py made by Mansi, our master key was generated by using the os module.
This master key was then encoded and saved in a file.

In the updated version, we are using the secrets module instead of the os module, and applying b64 encoding on it to convert it into a human readable version and save it as our master key. Although, there's no major difference between the two methods, it is generally recommended to use this.

We gotta convert it to b64 encoding because normal editors(vsc) can’t display arbitrary binary data.

Snippet for converting the MK from its og form to the readable form such that it can be stored in a file

--Since we have to supply the masterkey ourselves, so what we can do, is save the masterkey in b64 encoding, and just add an extra line to the program such that whenever it fetches or looks for the masterkey, it decodes it from our b64 variant to the binary data.--

^ We are now scrapping this as it lowkey fucked the program up

```py
import base64
base64.b64encode(mk)
```
