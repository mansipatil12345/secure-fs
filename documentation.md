Differences to note:

In the original crypto.py made by Mansi, our master key was generated by using the os module.
This master key was then encoded and saved in a file.

In the updated version, we are using the secrets module instead of the os module, and applying b64 encoding on it to convert it into a human readable version and save it as our master key. Although, there's no major difference between the two methods, it is generally recommended to use this.

We gotta convert it to b64 encoding because normal editors(vsc) can’t display arbitrary binary data.

Snippet for converting the MK from its og form to the readable form such that it can be stored in a file
```py
import base64
base64.b64encode(mk)
```
